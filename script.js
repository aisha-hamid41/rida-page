    "Salam RidağŸ¥¹ I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me.  Sometimes the heart speaks best in silence, but today, mine needed to speak through code :), I honeslty feel bad about what I did, It was a mistake, I messed up :( I miss our conversations, I'm just gonna be real here. My brain is jacked and I'm sooo stressedğŸ˜‚, I've no idea what to even be sayingğŸ˜‚, but then yeah, I've never quite done this before, coding ain't for the weakğŸ˜‚, but then Alhamdulillah this is sort of like a brain dump, Okay I don't think I deserve forgiveness, ughhh I'm the worstğŸ˜­, I'm so sorry my sisterğŸ˜”, I keep messing up these days and regretting it baig time, okay I don't think I'll end up showing this to you cos it dosen't seem good enoughğŸ˜”, I think i'll shut up now, Ok but I won't re-read this cos I know I'll prolly not end up sending it, but then yeah, I miss you girlğŸ«‚, May Allah soften your heartğŸ¥¹ğŸ«‚............";
